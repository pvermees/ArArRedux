Small samples ($df<20$) are characterised by skewed and broadly distributed MSWD distributions whose mean, median and mode are all less than 1. With increasing sample size ($df>20$), the probability distribution of the MSWD becomes more symmetric converges to an expected value of MSWD$\approx $1. }}{3}}
