Error propagation {#sec:errorpropagation}
-----------------

There are two approaches to propagating the age uncertainties in
^40^Ar/^39^Ar geochronology. The first is to explicitly calculate the
errors for each analysis separately. The second is to process multiple
analyses together by matrix algebra. Although the first approach is the
most common one, the second one is actually more practical and offers
significant advantages for higher order data processing steps
(Section \[sec:randomVSsystmatic\]).\
**Separate error propagation**\
Let $t_i$ be one of $n$ (i.e. $1 \leq i \leq n$) ^40^Ar/^39^Ar age
estimates:

$$t_i = \ln\left(1 + J R_i\right)/\lambda
  \label{eq:ti}$$

where $J$ is the irradiation constant, $R_i$ is the ^40^Ar/^39^Ar-ratio
and $\lambda$ is the ^40^K decay constant. Then the uncertainty
(standard error) of $t_i$ can be estimated as [@mcdougall1999]:

$$s[t_i] = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial t_i}{\partial R_i}\right)^2 s[R_i]^2 +
  \left(\frac{\partial t_i}{\partial J}\right)^2 s[J]^2} = \ldots =
  \frac{\sqrt{R_i^2 s[J]^2 + J^2 s[R_i]^2}}{\lambda (1 + J R_i)}
  \label{eq:sti}$$

Equation \[eq:sti\] assumes that the uncertainties of $J$ and $R_i$
(i.e., $s[J]$ and $s[R_i]$) are *independent* of each other, and that
the decay constant is known with zero uncertainty. In reality, neither
of these assumptions is correct [@vermeesch2015b]. But for the purpose
of this paper, we will assume that this makes little difference.\
**Joint error propagation**\
In an alternative approach, we can also propagate the uncertainties of
all the $t_i$s together, forming a *covariance matrix* $\Sigma_t$:

$$\Sigma_t = J_t ~ \Sigma_{RJ} ~ J_t'
  \label{eq:Sigmat}$$

where $\Sigma_{RJ}$ is the covariance matrix of the ^40^Ar/^39^Ar-ratios
and the irradiation constant:

$$\Sigma_{RJ} = \left[
    \begin{array}{ccccc}
      s[R_1]^2 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & s[R_2]^2 & \ldots & 0 & 0 \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
      0 & 0 & \ldots & s[R_n]^2 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & s[J]^2 \\
    \end{array}
    \right]
  \label{eq:SigmaRJ}$$

where the zero values mean that the uncertainties of $R_i$ and $J$ are
uncorrelated. This assumption is, of course, not correct in the general
case. But we are making it here for the sake of consistency with the
previous paragraph. $J_t$ is the Jacobian matrix (and $J_t'$ its
transpose) of partial derivatives of Equation \[eq:ti\] w.r.t. $R_i$ and
$J$:

$$J_t = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc}
      {\partial t_1}/{\partial R_1} & 0 & \ldots & 0 &
      {\partial t_1}/{\partial J}\\
      0 & \partial t_2/\partial R_2 & \ldots &
      0 & {\partial t_2}/{\partial J} \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
      0 & 0 & \ldots &
      {\partial t_n}/{\partial R_n} & {\partial t_n}/{\partial J}
    \end{array}\right]$$

Even though the off-diagonal terms of $\Sigma_{RJ}$ are zero, those of
$\Sigma_t$ generally are not. In other words, the uncertainties of the
different age estimates $t_i$ are correlated with each other. This is
important if we want to further process those estimates to calculate a
weighted average, say.

Random vs. systematic uncertainties {#sec:randomVSsystmatic}
-----------------------------------

Equation \[eq:sti\] contains two sources of analytical uncertainty:

-   $s[R_i]$ is a *random* error, which differs for each $i$.

-   $s[J]$ is a *systematic* error, which is the same for all $i$.

The random (or ‘internal’) uncertainties can be reduced to arbitrarily
low levels by simply increasing the number of aliquots ($n$). Their
effect on the standard error of the mean scales with $\sqrt{n}$. In
contrast, the systematic (or ‘external’) uncertainties cannot be
reduced. They impose a hard lower limit on the precision of the weighted
mean.\
There are two different but equivalent ways to address the difference
between these two types of analytical uncertainty. Hierarchical error
propagation [@renne1998; @min2000] processes the random uncertainties
first, and only then adds the systematic uncertainties. In an
alternative approach, the random and systematic sources of uncertainty
can also be processed jointly, using matrix algebra. Let us illustrate
these two approaches by calculating the weighted mean of $n$ single
grain age estimates.\
**Hierarchical error propagation**\
We first calculate the variance-weighted mean ^40^Ar/^39^Ar-ratio
$\overline{R}$:

$$\overline{R} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n R_i/s[R_i]^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n 1/s[R_i]^2}
  \label{eq:Rbar}$$

and its standard error:

$$s[\overline{R}] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n 1/s[R_i]^2}}
  \label{eq:sRbar}$$

Then, we use Equations \[eq:ti\] and \[eq:sti\] to calculate the
weighted mean age and its uncertainty:

$$\overline{t} = \ln\left(1 + J \overline{R}\right)/\lambda
  \label{eq:bart}$$

and

$$s[\overline{t}] =
  \frac{\sqrt{\overline{R}^2 s[J]^2 + J^2 s[\overline{R}]^2}}{\lambda (1 + J \overline{R})}
  \label{eq:sbart}$$

**Joint error propagation**\
Instead of the two-step procedure of the previous paragraph, the
weighted mean age and its uncertainty can also be obtained in one step.

$$\overline{t} = s[\overline{t}] \sqrt{t ~ \Sigma_t^{-1} ~ 1_{n,1}}
  \label{eq:bart2}$$

where $t$ is a row vector with the $n$ individual age estimates $t_i$,
$1_{n,1}$ is a column vector of $n$ ones, $\Sigma_t^{-1}$ is the inverse
of the covariance matrix (calculated using Equation \[eq:Sigmat\]), and
$s[\overline{t}]$ is given by

$$s[\overline{t}] =
  \sqrt{ \left( 1_{1,n} ~ \Sigma_{t}^{-1} ~ 1_{n,1} \right)^{-1} }
  \label{eq:sbart2}$$

Dispersion {#sec:dispersion}
----------

The degree to which the analytical uncertainties account for the
observed scatter between multiple measurements from the same sample may
be assessed by means of the Mean Square of the Weighted Deviates
[$MSWD$, @mcintyre1966], which is also known as the ‘reduced Chi-square
statistic’ outside of geochronology.\
**Hierarchical error propagation**\
In the context of the weighted mean age, the $MSWD$ of $n$ age estimates
is given by:

$$MSWD = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(R_i-\overline{R})^2}{s[R_i]}
  \label{eq:MSWD}$$

If the analytical uncertainties $s[R_i]$ are the only source of scatter
between the $n$ aliquots, then $MSWD \approx 1$.\
$MSWD$-values that are considerably greater than one indicate that there
is some excess scatter in the data, which cannot be explained by the
analytical uncertainties alone. This usually reflects the presence of
some geological *dispersion*. Possible causes of such dispersion may be
the protracted crystallisation history of a sample, variable degrees of
inheritance, or partial loss of radiogenic ^40^Ar by thermally activated
volume diffusion.\
$MSWD$-values that are close to zero indicate that the analytical
uncertainties have not been propagated correctly. In practice, this
often reflects the presence of undetected error correlations. For
example, if we were to apply Equation \[eq:MSWD\] to the actual ages
estimates ($t_i$) instead of the ^40^Ar/^39^Ar-ratios, then that would
lower the $MSWD$-value. This is because the uncertainty of the
irradiation constant $J$ is shared by all the $n$ age estimates, and
this is not accounted for by Equation \[eq:MSWD\].\
**Joint error propagation**\
In contrast with Equation \[eq:MSWD\], the matrix definition of the
$MSWD$ can use either the ^40^Ar/^39^Ar or the actual age estimates:

$$MSWD = \frac{1}{n-1}[t - \overline{t}] \Sigma_t^{-1} [t - \overline{t}]'
  \label{eq:MSWD2}$$

So the same $MSWD$-value is obtained if $t$ is replaced with $R$,
$\overline{t}$ with $\overline{R}$, and $\Sigma_t$ with $\Sigma_R$,
where the latter matrix groups the first $n$ rows and columns of
Equation \[eq:SigmaRJ\].

A synthetic example {#sec:example}
-------------------

Consider the dataset of ten ^40^Ar/^39^Ar-ratio measurements shown on
the first row of Table \[tab:example\]. Assume that these measurements
are associated with a 2% analytical uncertainty (i.e.
$s[R_i]/R_i = 0.02$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$).\

  : Example of 10 synthetic ^40^Ar/^39^Ar measurements drawn from a
  population with true ^40^Ar/^39^Ar=1, an irradiation parameter $J = 1$
  and a 2% analytical uncertainty for both $R$ and
  $J$.[]{data-label="tab:example"}

The ^40^Ar/^39^Ar-ages and uncertainties, given by Equations \[eq:ti\]
and \[eq:sti\], are shown on the second and third row of
Table \[tab:example\]. The weighted mean ^40^Ar/^39^Ar-ratio is
$\overline{R} = 1.001505$ (from Equation \[eq:Rbar\]) with a standard
error of $s[\overline{R}] = 0.000040$ (from Equation \[eq:sRbar\]).
Plugging these values into Equations \[eq:bart\] and \[eq:sbart\] yields
a weighted mean age and error of $\overline{t} = 1254.7$ and
$s[\overline{t}] = 18.1$, respectively.\
Plugging $R_i$ and $\overline{R}$ into Equation \[eq:MSWD\] yields a
value of $MSWD = 1.06$. This is close to unity and consistent with the
fact that the 2% analytical uncertainty fully accounts for the scatter
in the synthetic dataset. However, if we were to substitute $R_i$ and
$\overline{R}$ for $t_i$ and $\overline{t}$ in Equation \[eq:MSWD\],
then we would obtain $MSWD = 0.53 < 1$. In other words, the age
estimates are *underdispersed* with respect to the analytical
uncertainties if the random and systematic sources of uncertainty are
lumped together. As explained in the previous sections, these problems
can be avoided by jointly propagating all the measurements together.\
**Joint error propagation**\
Using Equation \[eq:Sigmat\] to obtain the covariance matrix of the age
estimates:

$$\Sigma_t = \left[
    \begin{array}{cccccccccc}
 644 & 325 & 324 & 330 & 324 & 326 & 318 & 325 & 325 & 329 \\
 325 & 656 & 327 & 333 & 327 & 329 & 321 & 328 & 328 & 333 \\
 324 & 327 & 654 & 332 & 326 & 328 & 321 & 328 & 327 & 332 \\
 330 & 333 & 332 & 676 & 332 & 334 & 326 & 333 & 332 & 337 \\
 324 & 327 & 326 & 332 & 651 & 327 & 320 & 327 & 326 & 331 \\
 326 & 329 & 328 & 334 & 327 & 659 & 322 & 329 & 328 & 333 \\
 318 & 321 & 321 & 326 & 320 & 322 & 629 & 321 & 321 & 326 \\
 325 & 328 & 328 & 333 & 327 & 329 & 321 & 657 & 328 & 333 \\
 325 & 328 & 327 & 332 & 326 & 328 & 321 & 328 & 654 & 332 \\
 329 & 333 & 332 & 337 & 331 & 333 & 326 & 333 & 332 & 674
    \end{array}
    \right]$$

Taking the square root of the diagonal terms of $\Sigma_t$ gives exactly
the same values for $s[t_i]$ as shown in Table \[tab:example\].
Similarly, we can calculate the weighted mean age and its uncertainty
using Equations \[eq:bart2\] and \[eq:sbart2\] instead of
Equations \[eq:bart\] and \[eq:sbart\]. Doing so yields in values of
$\overline{t} = 1253.2$ and $s[\overline{t}] = 18.9$. This only differs
slightly from the value obtained by hierarchical error propagation
because of numerical rounding errors. Similarly, the MSWD-value obtained
from Equation \[eq:MSWD2\] is (virtually) identical to that obtained
from Equation \[eq:MSWD\] at $MSWD = 1.06$.

Uncertainty budget of the ^40^Ar/^39^Ar method {#sec:budget}
----------------------------------------------

Sections \[sec:errorpropagation\]-\[sec:example\] have shown that
identical results can be obtained by hierarchical error propagation of
the random and systematic uncertainties, or by jointly propagating them
using matrix algebra. This is true for simple data processing steps such
as age calculation and averaging. But things are not so simple for more
complex operations such as radioactive decay, atmospheric argon, and
Ca-, Cl- or K-interference corrections. In those cases, the matrix
approach is the only practical way to keep track of all the error
correlations [@vermeesch2015b].\
Figure \[fig:accuracyVSprecision\] shows the results of a sensitivity
analysis performed at the WiscAr lab using a Nu Instruments Noblesse
multicollector mass spectrometer. The data processing chain for this
dataset involves (1) blank correction; (2) regression to the time of gas
inlet; (3) detector calibration and mass bias correction by comparison
with a synthetic gas mixture of known composition [@jicha2016]; (4)
correction of the sample and the calibration gas for the radioactive
decay of ^39^Ar and ^37^Ar; (5) correction for interfering neutron
reactions on K (on ^40^Ar), Ca (on ^36^Ar and ^39^Ar), and Cl (on
^36^Ar); (6) calculation and interpolation of the irradiation constant
($J$) using a reference material of independently known age; and (7) age
calculation using the ^40^K decay constant and its uncertainty.\
All these steps involve both random and systematic errors, which are
impossible to separate from each other. Thus, the hierarchical error
propagation approach is not possible in this case. Joint error
propagation by matrix algebra is the only option to keep track of the
complex interactions between the different sources of uncertainty. By
eliminating individual steps of this processing chain,
Figure \[fig:accuracyVSprecision\] reveals the relative effect of the
different corrections. These will differ for samples of different age
and composition.
