\subsubsection{Assessing goodness of fit: pitfalls and opportunities}
\label{sec:MSWD}

The random scatter of the data around an isochron or weighted mean fit
can be assessed using the Mean Square of the Weighted Deviates
\citep[MSWD,][]{mcintyre1966}. This statistic is more generally known
as the `reduced Chi-square statistic' outside geology. The MSWD is
defined as the sum of the squared differences between the observed and
the expected values, normalised by the analytical uncertainties and
divided by the degrees of freedom of the fit.  In the context of the
weighted mean age, the MSWD of $n$ values is given by:

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{MSWD} = \frac{1}{df} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\left(x_i
    - \bar{x}\right)^2}{\sigma_i^2}
  \label{eq:MSWD}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $x_i$ is the $i$\textsuperscript{th} (out of $n$)
dates, $\sigma_i$ is the corresponding analytical uncertainty, $df = n
- 1$ is the number of degrees of freedom, and $\bar{x}$ is the
weighted mean of all $n$ dates. The definition for the MSWD of an
isochron is similar but has one fewer degree of freedom (i.e., $df = n
- 1$) and involves a few more terms to account for correlated
uncertainties between the x- and y-variable.

\begin{enumerate}
\item If the analytical uncertainties $\sigma_i$ are the only source
  of scatter between the $n$ aliquots, and $df$ is reasonably large
  (for $n > 20$, say) then MSWD$\approx$1 (Fig.~5A,B).  For smaller
  sample sizes, the expected MSWD is less than one. See
  \citet{wendt1991} and Figure~1 of the Supplementary Information for
  further details.

\item MSWD values that approach zero indicate that analytical
  uncertainties have been overestimated or have not been propagated
  correctly (Fig.~5B,C). Assigning ages to samples based on such
  \emph{underdispersed} data should be done with caution.
  
\item MSWD-values considerably greater than one indicate that there is
  some excess scatter in the data, which cannot be explained by the
  analytical uncertainties alone. This usually reflects the presence
  of some geological \emph{(over)dispersion}. Possible causes of such
  dispersion may be the protracted crystallisation history of a
  sample, variable degrees of inheritance, or partial loss of
  radiogenic \textsuperscript{40}Ar by thermally activated volume
  diffusion (Figure~\ref{fig:MSWD}b).
\end{enumerate}

It would be wrong to believe that only datasets with MSWD$\approx$1
are suitable for publication.  It is tempting to trim an overdispersed
dataset by selectively rejecting `outliers' until p$>$0.05. However by
doing so one risks losing geologically valuable information and
biasing the results.  In fact, there is nothing wrong with MSWD values
greater than one.  On the contrary, high MSWD values should be
considered a good thing if they reflect the high analytical precision
of the data.  Underdispersed datasets are likely to become even more
prevalent in the future, as a result of the ever increasing resolution
of mass spectrometers \citep{phillips2013}. The degree of dispersion
can be formally assessed with a Chi-square test for homogeneity. The
overdispersion is `statistically significant' if the p-value of said
test falls below a pre-defined cutoff value (typically 0.05).\\
